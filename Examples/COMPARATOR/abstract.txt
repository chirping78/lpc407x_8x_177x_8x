@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This simple program is used to test COMPARATOR functionality        
    Process: 
        The test will show which voltage is higher comparing P1_5 and P1_7

@Directory contents:
    \Keil:    includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
    \EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
    
    cmptest.c: Main program

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
            
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
                        
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
        
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC4088 and OEM Base Board rev A
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Reset the board

The Blinky project is a simple demo program for the NXP 'LPC4088' 
microcontroller using Embedded Artists 'LPC4088-32 Developer's Kit',
compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL              =  12 MHz
   - PLL0              = 120 MHz
   - PLL1              =  48 MHz
   - CCLK   = PLL0 / 1 = 120 MHz
   - PCLK   = PLL0 / 2 =  60 MHz

 - SysTick Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - 2 LEDs blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
 - AD conversion is done in interrupt mode
 - AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 - AD value is output onto serial port UART2 
 - UART2 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  LPC4088 RAM:   runs from Internal RAM located on chip
                 (used for target debugging)

  LPC4088 Flash: runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                 (used for production or target debugging)

  LPC4088 SPIFI: runs from Internal Flash / SPIFI Flash
                 (module LED.c is located in SPI Flash)

@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This simple program is used to erase and program of the SPIFI device        
    Process:
        After reset, the SPIFI device will be initialized, then erased and programmed with the blinky binary. 
        Next, the program runs from the SPIFI blinky code.
        
        @Note: Pls reference bsp.h to know what led is used.

    Spifi_Test.c: Main program

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC4788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
                        
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
        
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC4788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Reset the board then we can see the LED1 blinking
        @Note: Pls reference bsp.h to know what led is used.

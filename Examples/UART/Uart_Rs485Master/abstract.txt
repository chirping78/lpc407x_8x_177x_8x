@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use RS485 functionality on UART of LPC1788
        in master mode.
    Process:    
        RS485 function on UART acts as Master mode on RS485 bus.
        Master device will send a specified slave device address value
        first, then master device will send data frames. After sending
        completed, master device wait for response from slave device (example RS485_slave).

    Uart_Rs485Master.c: Main program

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                
        RS485 Connection:
            J16-4 of Rs485 Master Board connects to J16-4 of Rs485 Slave Board.
            J16-5 of Rs485 Master Board connects to J16-5 of Rs485 Slave Board.
            JP6:     1-2: ON
                    3-4: OFF
                    5-6: ON
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Connect RS485 as above instruction (using ADM485)
        - Step 5: Run example and using Serial display to monitor the communication between master and slave.
